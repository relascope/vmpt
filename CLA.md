Contributor License Agreement
================================================
Guidelines for contribution. 
Since the Apple Store doesn't permit some Open Source licenses we want to
be able to relase the software under a different license. 

 * You grant Günther Humer the ability to use the Contributions in any way. 
 You hereby grant to Günther Humer, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, 
 fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, 
 prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
 sublicense, and distribute your Contribution and such derivative works.
 
 * You are able to grant Günther Humer these rights. You represent that 
 You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer 
 has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent 
 that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf 
 of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for 
 the Contributions.
 
 * The Contributions are your original work. You represent that 
 the Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to 
 Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, 
 any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions. 
 You also represent that You are not legally obligated, 
 whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way 
 that conflicts with the terms of this license. 
 For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign 
 the intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer 
 or customer, that would conflict with the terms of this license.
 
 * Günther Humer determines the code that is in the vmpt project. 
 You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in 
 any project or source repository is entirely that of Günther Humer, 
 and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions 
 will be included in any product.
 
 * No Implied Warranties. Günther Humer acknowledges that, except 
 as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided 
 on an 
 "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
 EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
 ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
 MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
